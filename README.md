# PlantSensor
Sensors node to monitor ambient light, temperature, humitidy, noise and soil moisture.
It it also able to drive a water pump and two light and have a LoRa transceiver to hopefully prevent my house plants from dying (among other use)
it was designed with a few use case in mind : indoor plant, outdoor plant, weather station, mailbox notifier, environemental sensor (3 I2C port that can be used for with sensors @ 3V3)
it is low power (when en deepsleep) (current draw under 50 uA@3V7 and even less at 12V)

the PCB is 70 mm * 70 mm, i will add a better fixation system (mouting hole + some space for fixation bracket)

kicad schematic
BOM (20-30 CHF per unit, aliexpress as sole suplier)

## futur works
- assemble and test the PCB once its manufactured
- write code to use it

# PlantSensor
Sensors node to monitor ambient light, temperature, humitidy, noise and soil moisture.
It it also able to drive a water pump and two light and have a LoRa transceiver to hopefully prevent my house plants from dying (among other use)

kicad schematic
BOM (20-30 CHF per unit, aliexpress as sole suplier)

## futur works
- assemble and test the PCB once its manufactured
- write code to use it
